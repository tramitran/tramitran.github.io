    <h1>PROG 109 Recap Questions:Final Part 2</h1>
  <p>
  <b>1)	What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Java Script?</b>

    	Before taking PROG 109, I had no academic knowledge of any of the languages. It looked intimidating.  I knew that the languages were what made up a valid & working webpage, but just did not know how it worked, the proper terms, or the code.
</p>
<p> <b>2)	Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from stratch ?</b>

I used the template to complete my portfolio.
</p>

<p> <b>3)	What was the most challenging part of your portfolio?</b>

The most challenging part was figuring out how to use the hosting site GitHub. In the very beginning of the quarter, all we were doing with GitHub was uploading our html files,images, css files, and then java script files. But then when it came time to make a whole portfolio of all the assignments for the midterm, I had a problem creating proper paths to each assignment and file. It took sometime for me to figure it out. 
</p>

<p><b> 4)	How did taking this class change your view on Web Development?</b>
Although we only touched the surface of front end development, I can honestly say it is not as difficult as I always thought it was before this course. The languages take time to understand and remember but once I got the motion of things it was easier than I expected. 
</p>

<p> <b>5)	What would you recommend to future students talking this class?</b>
I would recommend for future students to take the time outside of class to study and practice web development to have a full understanding of it and to ask as many questions as possible. It isnâ€™t something that easy to learn in just the class time.
